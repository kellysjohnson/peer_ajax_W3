# Week 3 Thursday Peer Project JSON / AJAX

## Instructions

For this challenge you will be working with AJAX, Bootstrap, and jQuery. Awesome right?

The first thing you will need to do (besides set up your base project) is great a JSON object that has the information for Tokyo (better than Paris, that is why we saved it for this assignment!) More specifically, the name, area, and population of it (all one Google search away)

Once you have that JSON file created, now create a template file that will have a div container and then any other tag you need to display the information you created above. Finally, include a button that says ‘remove’. Note that part of the challenge of this assignment is having that separate HTML file.

Now, on your main HTML page, have an initiate button that starts the process to first grab the information stored in the JSON, save it to a global variable. Then pull in the HTML from the template file and write it to the DOM. Finally, write the information from the JSON to the HTML that you added with the template file.

(All very similar to what we did in Lecture)

Finally the remove button should remove the HTML code that was added from the initial request. 

### Hard Mode
Include multiple cities!

### Pro Mode
Update all of your HTML to responsive for mobile devices (using the Bootstrap col-xs-* sizing of course!)
